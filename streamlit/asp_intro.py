# Airline Satisfaction Analysis
### Prediction of passenger satisfaction
##### Context and Content:
What factors are highly correlated to a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger in an airline service.
#### 1. Data Source 
We found this dataset from kaggle, a series of files. This data set contains a survey on air passenger satisfaction. The dataset is free of cost and can be easily downloaded from the Kaggle website. 
#### 2. Data merging and cleaning
The next step was to merge the dataframes from Kaggle to a single dataframe and to clean it. We converted data into useful information as well as created new columns to analyize the data better.Identified the Null values and Filling in the missing values.
#### 3. Data Visualizations
In this part we did exploritory data analysis on the data and understood the relationships between the variables of the data by using graphs.   
#### 4. Applying Models
We applied four classification models, the logistic regressition, random forest, decision tree and Naive Bayes and then we compared the results. 
#### 5. Streamlit Presentation
We are presenting our project using streamlit platform. We used streamlite because streamlit is an open-source python framework for building web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science. Streamlit allows you to write an app the same way you write a python code.
